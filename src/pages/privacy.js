        <p>

          our visitors and operate our sites efficiently. Examples of when we
          rely on legitimate interests to use your personal data include:
        </p>

          <li>
            to collect and log IP addresses to improve the website and monitor
            website usage
          </li>
          <li>
            for security and fraud prevention, and to ensure that our sites and
            apps are safe and secure and used in line with our terms of use
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Service providers</h2>
        <p>
          We use different data processors in our daily processing. These
          process your personal data in accordance with the requirements of Art.

          only those who meet our high standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because we use different data processors and change them from time to
          time, it is not appropriate to identify specific recipients of
          personal information. However, if you are interested, we will be happy
          to disclose the name of the processor(s) in use at that time upon
          request.
        </p>
        <h2>Processing in third countries</h2>
        <p>
          We process your data mainly within the European Union (EU) and the
          European Economic Area (EEA). However, some of our service providers
          mentioned above are based outside the EU and the EEA.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before we transfer your personal data to any third parties, we
          carefully assess if these companies have adequate security measures in
          place and if they meet the requirements outlined by GDPR.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only if they can demonstrate an adequate level of data protection will
          they be shortlisted for service providers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regardless of whether our service providers are located within the
          EU/EEA or in third countries, each service provider must sign a data
          processing agreement with us. Service providers outside the EU/EEA
          must meet additional requirements. According to Art. 44 ff. GDPR
          personal data may be transferred to service providers that meet at
          least one of the following requirements:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Commission has decided that the third country ensures an adequate
            level of protection (e.g. Israel and Canada)
          </li>
          <li>Standard data protection clauses adopted.</li>
        </ol>
